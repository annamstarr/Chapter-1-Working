// 1. "simple" - This IS a legal identifier, but is not a good idea for a name because it does not begin with a  capital letter, which makes it difficult to differentiate from other lables.
// 2. "SimpleProgram" - This IS a legal identifier and a good idea for a name.
// 3. "1Simple" - This IS NOT a legal identifier because it begins with a digit (this will not compile).
// 4. "_Simple_" - This IS a legal identifier, but not a very good idea because it is awkward with the underscores and doesn't simply begin with a capital letter.
// 5. "*Simple*" - This IS NOT a legal identifier because it has two "*'s" (this will not compile).
// 6. "$123_45" - This IS a legal identifier, but not a very good idea for a name because it is undescriptive.
// 7. "Simple!" - This IS NOT a legal identifier because it has an "!" (this will not compile).
